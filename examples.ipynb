    "Welcome to the Meshgrid environment! Meshgrid is a duck-typed game engine. As such, the exact code specification for the engine is less important than its design, and the tests defining what constitutes a properly functioning version of the engine. For those without a Computer Science background, duck-typing follows the adage that \"if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck!\" Defining a game engine in this way frees programmers to write versions of Meshgrid for any particular platform, with a reasonable expectation that they'll play identically (framerate permitting). It could run within another game engine, such as Godot or Phaser. It could run within a Jupyter Notebook. It could even run on a chess board with custom pieces and some human hands to implement the rules. Subsequently this also implies that any game built entirely on the Meshgrid engine would be just as portable to other platforms as the core engine itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is still very early in development, so much of the grandeur of the previous paragraph would be somewhat difficult to achieve for now. However, even in its current state, it would be useful for two purposes: game prototyping and machine learning. A pure-python Jupyter Notebook version of the Meshgrid engine, alongside a minimalist canvas-based visualizer, constitute the first implementation of the engine.\n",
    "\n",
    "### _1.b How To Use It_\n",
    "\n",
    "Jump to the examples at the bottom of this notebook for live examples, and find their source-code in the `./meshgrid/examples/` folder. Once you have a new game class, you can feed it to the `GamePlayer` class to start an interactive session with your new game. That's it!\n",

    "## 2. Code\n",
    "\n",
    "### _2.a Overview_\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the package's structures revolve around wrapping Grid objects, and adding game I/O and visualizations to the components of Grid objects. A \"Grid\" itself is generally defined as being a collection of \"Pieces\" with a \"Board\". The pieces have a location and may also have game stats associated with them:\n",

    "  <img alt=\"Grid Diagram\" src=\"./images/grid_light.png\" width=500>\n",
    "</picture></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "A game typically will have just one Grid object, but it is entirely possible to use more than one Grid object in a game, or use a Grid object that has more than one \"layer\" by using a Multilayer Grid. Currently all Grid objects use Square Boards, but future implementations will include the option for Hexagonal Boards as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### _2.b Board & Loc_\n",
    "\n",
    "The Board itself is represented as a 2D array of squares. The ID of each piece is written into the square on the board where the piece is located (with empty squares represented by `-1`). The Loc and Stats objects are also 2D arrays, where the first index is the piece's \"unit ID\". Loc holds the location of the piece on the board, but in `(i,j)` coordinates. This implies that you can find the location of a piece in two ways: by finding the piece's ID on the Board, or by looking at the `(i,j)` value for that piece in Loc. See the diagram below (with row and columns given descriptors in gray for clarity):\n",
    "\n",

    "  <img alt=\"Board vs Loc Diagram\" src=\"./images/board_vs_loc_light.png\" width=500>\n",
    "</picture></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the same image with some highlighting to make it clearer what numbers are `unit IDs` (red), and what numbers are `i` (green) and `j` (blue) coordinates:\n",
    "\n",
    "<center><picture>\n",
    "  <source media=\"(prefers-color-scheme: dark)\" srcset=\"./images/board_vs_loc_color_dark.png\" width=500>\n",

    "</picture></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "By tracking the piece location in two ways (via Board and Loc), it offers some convenience in checking if pieces are adjacent to other pieces (by making it an `O(1)` lookup on the Board) while still making it easy to find a piece's `(i,j)` location by ID (an `O(1)` lookup in Loc) or to loop through all pieces (by looping over the first dimension of Loc or Stats).\n",
    "\n",
    "Grid object functions that move pieces will update both Board and Loc (but never Stats!) If you plan to update Board manually then it is recommended you call the grid function `rebuild_loc_from_board()` to update Loc accordingly. Likewise, if you plan to update Loc manually then it is recommended you call the grid function `rebuild_board_from_loc()` to update the Board accordingly. In this way, you can use Grid object piece-moving functions, or update Board or Loc directly yourself to move pieces around. In general the Meshgrid game engine aims for flexibility and ease of use whenever possible. Do note that since this is an early version of the engine, it may still be a little tricky to use!"
